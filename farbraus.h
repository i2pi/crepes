.the .crepes

a demo in well under 64kb 

by 

.i2pi consume caffeine



released at 
coven 2001
final version (1.01) 



hi, jd here... at the moment i'm 
sitting at coven in front of my 
pc and don't know what to write... 
but we still have 220 kbytes to fill 
and are seriously running out of ideas. 
therefore, we waste that "precious" 
space with senselessness at its best. 
(heut ist ein gutter tag ze struben -neardark) 


so let's start with the usual stuff any 
decent end scroller has to feature: 


.the crepe was designed 
specifically for your tastebuds
by our local employees 

jdigital 
(demo, tool code and 
making it possible) 

compagnie 
(concept, graphics, 3d, 
design, content and choreography) 

loonie 
(music, synthesizer, 
additional code) 

 
some facts about the crepes

in the next thirty minutes, 
your computer will be not very
busy producing 

0 colorful textures, 
thats about 0 mb, 
0 mb including 
intermediate textures 

30 minutes of sound 
303 mb of wave data, 
in about 1 tracks, 
that totals to lots 
of samples 

0 colored and 
textured triangles 
in 0 mb of static 
vertex buffers, 
including animated 
geometry. 


that's a grand total of 9.7 gb 
of data, or a compression ratio 
of 300000 to 1, if you want to 
put it that way. 

of course, the full soundtrack 
is available on cd, mc and mp3, vinyl just 
grab, encode and burn it. same 
with vhs/mpeg/divx versions of this 
demo. 





the crepe makes you feel 
the urge to eat 

sugar
mcdonalds
french fries
macadamia nut biscuits
mars bars
jellied candies
aurora super burgers
fruit flan
pho ba go
horseradish
saurkraut
girls
kidney beans
3minute noodles


anyway, we hope that this little 
demonstration convinced you to 
buy the crepe. never forget, 
the crepe will make you hungry. 

so don't hesitate, stop whining, 
go find your local product dealer at 

http://www.i2pi.com 



you may press escape now. 























ok 
obviously you didn't. 
well, let's start with the fun part of 
this scroller. not that i'd have the 
slightest clue what to write in here, 
but there's still plenty of memory to 
fill up. 

at the moment, the das saint concert was 
run about 2 months ago. i must say, 
the bass speakers of this year's audio system 
sucked. yeah. looking forward to 
see this demo on the big screen. definitely. 

ok, jdigital taking over... 

cool show! das saint just stand on the 
stage and pretend to play thier instruments. 
wow! 

no one just made the beta-version of the 
data files, and i feel much safer now, 
1 hour before the deadline. a few bugs, 
some more lines of scrolltext, and we 
should be done with this demo. i have 
to continue my work now,
